The development and use of AI requires governance and regulation to ensure that these technologies are deployed in a responsible and sustainable manner. In this chapter, we will explore international and national policies and guidelines, as well as self-regulation and industry standards.

International and National Policies and Guidelines
--------------------------------------------------

There are several international and national policies and guidelines related to the development and use of AI, including:

* European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): This regulation sets out rules for the collection, storage, and use of personal data, including data collected by AI systems.
* United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): These goals include several targets related to the use of AI, including promoting innovation and ensuring that technology benefits everyone.
* National AI Strategies: Several countries have developed national AI strategies outlining their approach to the development and use of AI, including Canada, France, and China.

Self-regulation and Industry Standards
--------------------------------------

In addition to government policies and guidelines, there are also industry standards and self-regulation mechanisms related to AI. Some examples include:

* IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems: This initiative develops standards and recommendations related to the ethical design and deployment of AI systems.
* Partnership on AI: This organization brings together stakeholders from academia, industry, and civil society to develop best practices and guidelines for the development and use of AI.
* Ethical AI Frameworks: Many companies and organizations have developed their own ethical AI frameworks, outlining principles and guidelines for the development and use of AI.

Conclusion
----------

Governance and regulation are critical for ensuring that AI is developed and used in a responsible and sustainable manner. By adhering to international and national policies and guidelines, as well as self-regulation and industry standards, we can create AI systems that benefit everyone and contribute to social progress and economic growth. It is important to ensure that ethical considerations are at the forefront of AI development and deployment, and that these technologies are used to promote human well-being and social progress.
