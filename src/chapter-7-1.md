International and National Policies and Guidelines
========================================================================================

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into our society, there is a growing need for governance and regulation of its development and deployment. Governments around the world are beginning to establish policies and guidelines for the responsible use of AI. In this chapter, we will explore international and national policies and guidelines for AI governance and regulation.

International Policies and Guidelines
-------------------------------------

Several international organizations have established policies and guidelines for the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. These include:

* **The United Nations**: The UN has established the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, which provides guidance on the ethical and legal implications of AI.
* **The European Union**: The EU has established guidelines for the development and deployment of AI systems, which emphasize transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights.
* **The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**: The OECD has established principles for the responsible development and deployment of AI systems, which emphasize inclusivity, transparency, and accountability.

These international policies and guidelines provide a framework for governments and organizations to develop their own policies and guidelines for the responsible use of AI.

National Policies and Guidelines
--------------------------------

Many countries have established their own policies and guidelines for the responsible use of AI. For example:

* **China**: China has established the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which outlines a roadmap for the development and deployment of AI in China.
* **United States**: The US government has established the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, which provides guidance on the responsible development and deployment of AI.
* **Canada**: The Canadian government has established the Directive on Automated Decision-Making, which requires that federal departments and agencies be accountable for the decisions made by AI systems they use.

These national policies and guidelines provide guidance for the development and deployment of AI systems within their respective countries.

By establishing international and national policies and guidelines for AI governance and regulation, we can help ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner that benefits society as a whole.
